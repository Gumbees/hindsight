According to a UNESCO report, about 60% of Venice's historic buildings are at risk from rising sea levels and flooding, including St. Mark's Basilica, which has suffered significant damage over the years. Saltwater can cause rapid deterioration of artwork and artifacts such as frescoes, paintings, and sculptures. The report estimates that Venice loses around 3-4 million euros worth of cultural heritage assets each year, a figure expected to rise as sea levels continue to rise and flooding frequency increases.",
